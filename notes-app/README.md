## About <a name = "about"></a>

There are different versions of these pages, we made an initial version but later we reorganized it to use with modules, webpack and babel. For more information check each project's folder and/or different branches of this project.

A lot of times I make changes to the course projects and exercises, I try some new things, add something here and there or even extrapolate to something different.

I know that there are several projects alike from Internet courses and tutorials out there so I will only document the tests I've done and the things I've changed.

## Improvements made <a name = "improvements"></a>

- I've played a little bit with the CSS and the color palette
- Added remove button on the front page
  - Otherwise the user would need to edit the note the remove
  - Prevent unnecessary extra step
- Added save button on the edit page
  - We are used to click a button to save, only having the remove button could lead to accidental remove notes
  - If the user leave the editing page the note will save as a draft
